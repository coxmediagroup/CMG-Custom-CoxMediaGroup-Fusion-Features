        <p>
          Thank you for your interest in the CoxReps website. We have developed this Privacy Statement to provide you with information about
          how CoxReps collects, uses, and shares information about you as a visitor to our website, including the choices CoxReps offers
          with respect to that information, and applies to your use of any service, regardless of how you access or use it.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          By using CoxReps’ website, you consent to the use of information about you in accordance with this Privacy Statement and agree to
          our Visitor Agreement. If you do not agree and consent, please discontinue use of our website. Unless otherwise noted in
          communications you may receive from us, this Privacy Statement does not apply to information you may provide to us through offline
          methods.

          <b>THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT&nbsp;</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          <u>Anonymous User Data</u>:<b>&nbsp;</b>CoxReps’ web servers automatically collect and store certain limited information about a
          visitor’s connection to the Internet, including the visitor’s IP address, whenever the visitor browses the website. A visitor’s IP
          address is aggregated and/or de-identified, and the information does not identify individuals/consumers. CoxReps uses this
          information to deliver content on CoxReps’ website to a visitor, to measure traffic within the website, and to tailor website
          content to general, aggregated classes of IP addresses. We also share IP address information with Google Analytics, as described
          more fully below.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          <u>Personally-Identifiable Information</u>:<b>&nbsp;</b>CoxReps does not collect any personally-identifiable information (such as
          a visitor’s name or email address) when a visitor browses our website. The only personally-identifiable information that CoxReps
          gathers through our website is information that a visitor voluntarily provides to us.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          If a visitor provides CoxReps with his or her name, email address, phone number, business address, and/or other
          personally-identifying information when the visitor uses the website to submit an inquiry or request, CoxReps may use the
          visitor’s personally-identifying information to send him or her a response and CoxReps may, but is not obligated to, keep a record
          of visitor’s personally identifying information.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          If a visitor uses the website to direct an inquiry or request to one of CoxReps’ affiliates, CoxReps will forward the visitor’s
          request and related personally-identifying information to the appropriate affiliate so that the affiliate can respond to the
          visitor’s inquiry. CoxReps’ affiliates’ use of the personally-identifying information collected through this website will be
          governed by this Privacy Statement. If a visitor inadvertently submits personally-identifying information to this website, CoxReps
          is not responsible for deleting or refusing to accept any such personally-identifying information, however, such inadvertent
          submissions shall receive all the privacy protections contained herein.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          CoxReps does not disclose, sell, or share any personally-identifiable or anonymous data collected through the website to third
          parties except as provided in this Privacy Statement. CoxReps may use information about you for any purpose not inconsistent with
          this Privacy Statement, or otherwise made by us in writing at the point of collection, and not prohibited by applicable law.
          CoxReps reserves the right to disclose to third parties collected information when CoxReps believes that such disclosure is
          necessary or appropriate to comply with law or to protect the safety or property of CoxReps, visitors to our website, the public,
          or CoxReps’ affiliates and personnel. CoxReps may also use a visitor’s information as necessary to comply with CoxReps’ legal
          obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce CoxReps’ agreements.
        </p>
        <p>
          CoxReps also reserves the right to disclose personally-identifying information about a visitor to the third-party
          contractors/vendors that CoxReps engages to assist CoxReps with the operation of the website or other aspects of CoxReps’ business
          when the contractor/vendor needs access to such information for the sole purpose of performing the services that CoxReps has
          requested. In the event that CoxReps merges with another entity or otherwise transfers substantially all of its assets to another
          entity, personally-identifiable information collected about visitors to the website would be among the transferred assets.&nbsp;
