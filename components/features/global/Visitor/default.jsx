          <b>DISPUTE RESOLUTION – ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER&nbsp;</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Visitor may opt-out of this Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver (“Arbitration Agreement”) by emailing CoxReps at{' '}
          <a href="mailto:inquiries@coxreps.com">inquiries@coxreps.com</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          the following information: (1) Visitor’s name; (2) Visitor’s address; and (3) a clear statement that Visitor does not wish to
          resolve disputes with CoxReps through arbitration. Visitor’s decision to opt-out of this arbitration provision will have no
          adverse effect on his or her relationship with CoxReps, but CoxReps must receive this opt-out request within 30 days from the date
          that Visitor’s first consent to these Terms. Any opt-out request received after this deadline will not be valid and Visitor must
          pursue his or her dispute in arbitration or small claims court.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>UNLESS VISITOR OPTS-OUT OF THESE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES AS SET FORTH ABOVE AND EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE DESCRIBED HEREIN:&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          VISITOR AND COXREPS EACH AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW, ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, AS DEFINED BELOW, WHETHER PRESENTLY IN
          EXISTENCE OR BASED ON ACTS OR OMISSIONS IN THE PAST OR IN THE FUTURE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING
          ARBITRATION, RATHER THAN IN COURT, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          <u>Arbitration&nbsp;</u>
        </p>
        <p>
          Visitor and CoxReps agree to arbitrate – rather than litigate in court – any and all claims or Disputes that may arise between
          Visitor and CoxReps, including any of CoxReps’ parent companies or organizations, subsidiaries, affiliates, and each of their
          managers, owners, officers, directors, employees, or agents. The term “Dispute” means any claim or dispute that may arise out of
          or in any way relates to Visitor’s relationship with CoxReps, including without limitation regarding these Terms, or the Service
          or products or services that CoxReps, its affiliates and/or service providers may provide to Visitor on CoxReps’ behalf in
          connection with Visitor’s use of the Service, including, without limitation, any Dispute based in contract, statute, regulation,
          ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, negligence, gross negligence or
          reckless behavior), or any other legal or equitable theory, and includes the validity, enforceability or scope of this Arbitration
          Agreement (with the exception of the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver clause below). “Dispute” is to be given the
          broadest possible meaning that will be enforced. However, in no event shall this Arbitration Agreement prevent Visitor, in his or
          her individual capacity, from filing or joining a complaint with any federal, state, or local government agency that is authorized
          by law to seek relief against CoxReps. The arbitration between Visitor and CoxReps will be binding, and judgment on the award
          rendered in the arbitration may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Arbitration is a form of private dispute resolution in which parties to a contract agree to submit their Disputes and potential
          Disputes to a neutral third person (called an arbitrator) for a binding decision, instead of having such Dispute(s) decided in a
          lawsuit, in court, by a judge or jury trial. This Arbitration Agreement provides that all Disputes between Visitor and CoxReps
          shall be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration replaces the right to go to court. In the absence of this Arbitration
          Agreement, Visitor might otherwise have a right or opportunity to bring claims in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to
          participate in or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including, but not limited to, class actions). Entering into
          this Arbitration Agreement constitutes a waiver of Visitor’s right to litigate claims in court and all opportunity to be heard by
          a judge or jury. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. The
          arbitrator’s authority is governed by these Terms. Visitor and CoxReps agree that an arbitrator must follow and be governed by
          this Arbitration Agreement and may only award such relief as a court of competent jurisdiction could award, limited to the same
          extent as a court would limit relief pursuant to these Terms. An arbitrator may award attorneys’ fees and costs if a court would
          be authorized to do so and may issue injunctive or declaratory relief if that relief is required or authorized by the applicable
          law, but that injunctive or declaratory relief may not extend beyond Visitor and Visitor’s dealings with CoxReps and may not
          include class or collective action relief. Discovery may be limited in arbitration, and procedures are more streamlined than in
          court.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Notwithstanding this Arbitration Agreement, Visitor and CoxReps may bring appropriate claims against each other regarding Disputes
          in small claims court, if the claims fall within the small claims court’s jurisdiction, or, on an individual and not class or
          collective action basis, before any other federal, state, or local government agency authorized by law to hear Visitor’s
          claims.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          <u>Informal Dispute Resolution&nbsp;</u>
        </p>
        <p>
          Visitor and CoxReps agree to try to resolve Disputes informally before resorting to arbitration. If the Dispute cannot be resolved
          by telephone, Visitor agrees to notify CoxReps of the Dispute by sending a written description of Visitor’s claim to CoxReps, 885
          2nd Ave, 24thFloor, New York, NY 10017 so that CoxReps can attempt to resolve it with Visitor. If CoxReps does not satisfactorily
          resolve Visitor’s Dispute within 30 calendar days of receiving notice of it, then Visitor may pursue the Dispute in arbitration.
          Neither Visitor nor CoxReps may initiate arbitration without first providing notice to the other of the Dispute and following the
          informal Dispute resolution procedure provided in this paragraph.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>INDEMNIFICATION&nbsp;</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Visitor agrees to indemnify and hold CoxReps and its affiliates, service providers, and licensors, and all of their respective
          officers, directors, employees and agents, harmless from and against any and all losses, expenses, damages and costs, including
          reasonable attorneys' fees, that arise out of Visitor’s use of the Service, violation of these Terms by Visitor, or Visitor’s
          violation of any rights of another. CoxReps reserves the right to control the defense of any action for which it is entitled to
          indemnification hereunder. In such event, Visitor agrees to cooperate with CoxReps, at CoxReps’ expense, as it may reasonably
          request in connection with its defense of the applicable claim.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>MISCELLANEOUS</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          <u>Governing Law</u>. By utilizing this website, Visitor agrees that these Terms shall be construed in accordance with the laws of
          the State of Georgia without regard to its conflicts of laws principles.
        </p>
        <p>
          <u>No Waiver</u>. Any waiver by CoxReps of a breach of any provision of these Terms shall not operate as or be constructed to be a
          waiver of any other breach of that provision or of any breach of any other provision of these Terms. If any one or more of the
          provisions contained in these Terms shall be held to be illegal, invalid, unenforceable or void in any respect by any arbitration
          proceeding or court of competent jurisdiction, these Terms and any other provision herein shall not be rendered null and void and
          shall not be affected or impaired.&nbsp;
